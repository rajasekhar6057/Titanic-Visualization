# Titanic Visualization using Tableau

Produce a visualization using tableau and the dataset included in this repository, where you can find the dataset and a readme file describing the dataset. Once you complete your tableau notebook, you will add it to your repository and check it back into github. For this assignment create a visual story that tells how gender and financial status helped determine your chances of surviving. The story should be a single image/dashboard. You can get [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students) for class use.
